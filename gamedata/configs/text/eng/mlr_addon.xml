		<text>Why exactly is this place called the ‘flea market’?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_baraholka_hunter_trader_1">
		<text>Never been to such a place in the Great Land? Let’s just say this place is a market, albeit an unusual market. There are no big shot hucksters around here like Sidorovich, only guys that sell what they owe and what they find out and about! By the way, you can get some nice goods around here at night, and the whole place has also got a nice background to it. A while ago, there were a bunch of guys in the ruins of the building nearby until they were driven off by Dutyers who didn’t particularly like the fact that they were trading artefacts. Those bastards didn’t care where they got it from or how; only the prices mattered to them! They decided to bring back the past recently, the Duty boys holed up in their bar anyway, and the bandits don’t know about this place. The building’s inconspicuous and quite cosy. I don’t even know where that steel door leads. I joined them later, when my combat skills started to soften up…</text>

		<text>Tell me about this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_gar_talk_to_choper_1">
		<text>What can I say? This place isn’t really the best. Radiation chews you up through the arse, and it’s full of Duty and bandit freaks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_gar_talk_to_choper_2">
		<text>And how are the sights?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_gar_talk_to_choper_3">
		<text>I guess the flea market here is the main landmark. There’s also the train hangar north of here, but don’t go there; it’s chock full of bandits. Further north along the road is the entrance to the Bar, guarded by Duty sentries. Close by near the road to the Cordon is a substation of some sort, but nobody goes there. It’s just a good-for-nothing area full of anomalies. And, by the way, we’ve got a whopping three spots full of anomalies in the area, and, unfortunately, one of them is in the substation itself; lots of Electros and stuff. The stalkers have chosen these areas and aren’t letting anyone pass, although that doesn’t matter to the bandits, who haven’t actually come here to hunt artefacts, but rather steal them from anyone who possesses them, which is why they have such a strategic advantage, being located right by the entrance to the Bar and all. The wildlife here ain’t too bad, as long as you stay on the surface and out of the substation. There’s a tunnel that the railway in the train hangar leads into, and damned if I or even the bandits know what’s there… ugh, and I’ve heard that a certain type of local fauna has started gathering there.</text>

	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_0">
		<text>Since you’re an expert hunter, I’d like to know some more about mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_1">
		<text>There are a few cute rodents in the Zone, called ‘tushkanos’. You’ve seen them for sure. They don’t really seem dangerous, but in packs, they can easily kill even an experienced stalker. There was a case where a special detachment of Dutyers went to sweep a bloodsucker lair. Those blokes made camp somewhere in the middle of the Agroprom complex. One of the guys took off somewhere while another screwed around on his PDA. No one was keeping the night watch. Morning came, and no one was there; something was wrong. The first people to set foot in that room were in for a big surprise… The throats of the squad members had been all chewed up. Typical tushkano traces. God knows why the rodents just up and left their meal. Anyway, the rest of the soldiers decided to head to the lair and finish the job, writing off the deaths of their comrades afterwards. That’s how those men perished. Some stalker ended up retrieving their PDAs, having a new story to tell in the Bar for shits and giggles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_2">
		<text>Every rookie encounters a few dogs at the Cordon, as well as in the Great Land. They don’t really differ that much from their ‘prototypes’, so to speak; except they’re blind, but that doesn’t really keep them down, since their other senses have evolved… especially their ability to smell. They can take out newbies like fish in a barrel, and sometimes more experienced stalkers, too, mostly thanks to their mobility and swift strikes. Oi, here’s a story for you: somebody made it a habit to snatch some sausage from the Bar. Everyone raised some fuss, tore up the security, and some men from Duty even ended up keeping watch and check who was stealing. Eventually, they saw a dog run in through a hole in the fence and, naturally, shot it down. In the morning, a solemn-looking stalker comes into the Bar and asks about the dog. Barman realises what’s happening and tells him to ask the guys from Duty. Turns out the fresh-faced lad was moving to the Zone with that dead dog, who was his pet. They went though a lot. The guy was also an orphan, and then this happens to him. Ever since that moment, any wise guy who crosses the border into the Zone with a pet either keeps moving or makes dinner out of his ‘little friend’ for other stalkers… just to keep tensions low. By the way, all that sausage was actually stolen by a local alcoholic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_3">
		<text>There are dogs, and there are pseudodogs. Why ‘pseudo’, you ask? Well, they originally evolved from wild wolves. On their own, they are easily dispatched by point blank buckshot rounds, much like ordinary wild dogs. However, a pack of pseudodogs is nothing to scoff at. Moreover, they conjure clones of themselves that swarm you… and when that happens, you need to find and kill the real one for the phantoms to stop appearing, otherwise you end up wasting precious ammo and risk getting yourself badly hurt. Those creatures are very reasonable, though, and there are even legends about, claiming they can be tamed. The Swamp Doctor’s pseudodog is an example. You can go find him if you don’t believe me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_4">
		<text>Let me tell you about snorks. The most common theory is that they’re former military personnel who guarded the Chernobyl nuclear power plant before the second explosion, when it completely fried their brains and turned them into abominations. Something like a zombie, only… even more bestial and primitive. Another theory is that they were exposed to some kind of gas prior to their change, which explains why all of them wear gas masks. When the first emission struck, it was powerful enough to vaporise anyone in the vicinity of the power plant in the blink of an eye, even collapsing underground structures, causing the substance to leak out of a secret complex or something. They crawl on all fours, claw, kick, and even pounce fairly long distances to close in on their prey. Just one is dangerous, but a group of them? Might as well off yourself right then and there. If you ever come across snorks, sidestep their pounce, then blast their ass full of lead. Heck, if you’re confident, but also have a death wish, you can kill them in midair. Good luck with that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_5">
		<text>Zombies. You know those flicks where zombies just grunt, moan, and attack with their hands? Well, it ain’t like that in Zone… sort of. Most zombies here are former stalkers, their brains completely mashed, torn, and battered by the Brain Scorcher. A lot of them still retain their speech and are also capable of operating firearms. It’s hard to understand what they’re saying most of the time. Many of them are also slaves to a controller that exploits them for various purposes, although rarely, the controller uses his ‘servants’ as food. Sakharov might be able to give you a better understanding. There’s also a more barbaric, generic type of zombie, more like the ones you see in movies. They’re slow, and not at all capable of using guns, so it should be simple to kill them… just don’t let yourself get cornered. They also feign death quite well; shoot them anywhere other than the head, and they’ll fall over and wait for your closure. It’s best to confirm the kill by putting a hole in their brains from a distance while they’re down, as they emit lots of radiation up close. According to a few documents discovered by the Marked One during his prime years, as well as a few other stalkers, the uniforms some of the more ordinary zombies wear was experimental, suggesting the zombies might’ve been something more than just working men. It’s likely they originate from laboratories and complexes, and there’s bound to be more of them located underground, so be wary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_6">
		<text>Bloodsuckers, perhaps? Let’s see. Rumour has it they’re mutated human beings. Whether or not they mutated from the radiation after the explosions or were scientifically modified by other humans, I don’t know. What I do know, however, is that they’re one of the most dangerous predators inhabiting the Zone. Not only do they boast incredible speed, but they also camouflage themselves, making them extremely dangerous and aggressive beasts. They use stealth and circle around you, tiring your legs out, waiting for the perfect moment to strike; and when they do, it’s curtains for you. See, their name speaks for itself. They drain so much blood that by the time you unhinge those slimy feelers off your neck, you might as well be a piece of paper floating in the wind. I’ve heard stories of a stalker having committed suicide while being circled indefinitely by a bloodsucker. It’s almost like a game to them, really. When they’re not sucking your blood through a straw, their razor sharp claws come into play. Just like snorks, you can avoid their attacks, but you gotta expect it: be alert, use a shotgun, aim for the head, then fire. Rookies end up with empty mags and often fatal wounds. You’d better find a high spot or stick close to an object, keeping both of your eyes open, because the bastard will appear right before you. Keep your trigger finger on the ready and fire right as the sucker closes in. That’s the best tactic if they find you alone… Running away from them is problematic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_7">
		<text>Burers. They are near-legendary creatures, the existence of which many don’t even want to know… Personally, I crap myself with fear just thinking about them. The best advice I can give regarding burers is to not head into dungeons or any kinds of empty complexes, laboratories in particular, because they love dwelling in such places. Recently, though, they have been sighted in pretty much every place in the Zone, and this is primarily thanks to to the actions of the Marked One, who turned off the Brain Scorcher. Chimeras too, for example, used to live closer to the centre of the Zone, but then suddenly migrated and increased their population. Apparently, someone who runs all of this in the centre of the Zone has got some influence over these creatures and is using them as a kind of Cerberus on the last approaches towards their ‘stronghold’. If you get into trouble and end up unable to escape, I’d advise you to protect your head, because they’ve got relatively powerful telekinesis powers. They can fire a focused impulse and knock you off your feet, and also take away your weapons and exhaust you, somehow influencing the gravity around you. They resemble fat, hideous dwarfs, who wear jumbo shoes with their own characteristic sounds, as well as black cloaks, strangely enough sewn almost their size. I too think that they are the result of experiments in secret laboratories. There are also different subspecies of burers, for example fire and electric, just like poltergeists. Some argue that the poltergeist is an evolutionary stage of the burer… however, if an electric poltergeist acts on you only with telekinesis, then a corresponding burer can easily throw a ball of lightning at you or even a whole Electra anomaly, the size of a substation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_8">
		<text>Controllers are no joke: those monsters emit a steady psy-background and can manipulate the consciousness of any person. It’s absolutely fatal to approach them without the right type of protection, and you’re generally better off staying away from any places they might be dwelling in. They’ll most likely just burn your brain out, not even zombifying you, in order to make some juicy grub out of you right then and there. Legend’s going around saying that they can even talk, but I don’t really believe in that. Their high level of intellect is beyond doubt, though. Sometimes they can stage clever ambushes. They often wander alone, greedy for food, or thinking about whatever goes on in that screwed-up head of theirs. A stalker once dropped by and told me and the boys that there was a weird creature that settled down around Rostok. He went to have a look, but was stopped by a sudden, severe headache that almost made him drop his gun, so he backed off, thinking it was just radiation. The rest of us went with him to scoop the place out. We came in, and I also felt a headache! Later, we went back prepared, having taken some special pills that basically got rid of any emotions in our body. I looked around and saw a man-shaped figure sitting in the darkness. I opened fire, but it disappeared, and then, the bastard came out behind my back, and I shot him. Then I heard a faint, yet familiar voice… and couldn’t believe it. I had shot down my friend Vasyuk. Eventually we managed to get rid of that mutant freak, but I quit hunting ever since and ended up opening a bar here. I was fortunate not to get killed. Redhead was a smart guy, so he took off to the north after what happened.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_9">
		<text>And the cats… Have you seen those things? Oh, god. Only this place can turn pets into feral beasts. Their whole thyroid is swollen from all the radiation, along with tumours located inside their cheeks. I don’t really know why those cats have become like this. They’ve grown in size with sharper claws, and they run like crazy. People usually have to get domestic cats down from trees; here, you’re the one who gets chased around. To make matters worse, they’ve developed a pack mentality similar to dogs and wolves. They’re wild and they can be found anywhere in the Zone, so keep an eye on your surroundings at all times. They come running, and if you aren’t careful, they will cling onto your ass and have a nice, tasty bite.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_10">
		<text>Not many people here believe in the paranormal, and everyone has their own faith. Some people believe in their own strength, some believe in their leaders, and some believe in alien intervention… but certainly not in God. However, there is still a monster by the name of ‘poltergeist’, because how else would you describe a translucent flying abomination that throws objects at you? Still, there’s pretty much nothing in common between the mutant and the type of entity in folklore. You can kill it in quite ordinary ways. It doesn’t react to salt—we had a poor bastard that tried it—and takes the appearance of a flying electric anomaly, or, less commonly, a fire essence. The electric one loves showering you with all sorts of random rubbish, just like a burer, but the fire one is somehow able to create a jet of fire right in front of your face, similar in effect to a geyser and extremely hot. Shoot directly into the essence; you won’t miss, but it is very difficult to kill because of its speed and manoeuvrability. In a few cases, stalkers have spotted some kind of black or smoky poltergeist. Nothing certain is known about its properties, but it’s quite a rare specimen, and probably so because meeting with it means death in the vast majority of cases. It’s even more difficult to kill because of its smoke that’s harder to trace. Thus, aiming and shooting at its core is more difficult.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_11">
		<text>There are also creatures whose tales are told in front of campfires. They are called fractures. Humanoid creatures with hypertrophic arms and necks, they possess an abnormal hand that can break a person’s chest, while the other is more often than not normal, without any anomalous property. There are a lot of stories about the fact that Fractures often like to come into contact with stalkers and ask for all kinds of crap, anywhere from cans to imported toothpaste. If you aren’t lucky and don’t have what it asks of you, then prepare for a fight or a certain death… in particular death, because fractures often come into contact with the upper hand; for example, if you happen to be alone and he’s already holding you from behind with his bucketed hand. If you do have what it asks of you, don’t hand it over rushedly; rather, move away from it quietly and on all fours. That way, you won’t get harmed. Anyway, those are all stories… who really knows. Some even leave provisions in places where fractures have been spotted, in vain hopes to drive them off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_12">
		<text>Here’s another one: the pseudogiant. Usually, its height never exceeds that of a human’s… however, its huge hands can cause very strong shock waves, which is how it earned its name. Until recently, nothing about it was known, and it is most likely another of those abominations from the laboratories, thanks to the underground bellends who love to rummage around every single complex, not closing any doors behind them. To the north, there was some kind of military guy who never shut the door at some facility… at the Iron Forest in Zaton, I believe. Since then, these giants have been observed even in the vicinity of the Jupiter plant. By observing some of its features, it is possible to determine that ‘it’ was once a man, such as the small, hanging arms in front of the main ones, its skin, and a few other peculiar characteristics. It’s got some sharp teeth, but don’t worry about that, because it’s more likely to just knock you down and crush you. And don’t take its awkward appearance into account, because it never falls down and never goes astray. The best thing to do before venturing near an area where a pseudogiant has been spotted is to grab a couple of rifle grenades and a machine gun, as the skin and bones of the mutant have shown excellent resistance to small arms, and the creature itself is very resilient.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_13">
		<text>The chimera can rightfully be considered at the top of the food chain in the Zone. How come? It is a very clever creature: a nocturnal predator that can pounce at you with a single jump from a distance of several tens of metres. Four-legged mutant, has two heads, for which it has received its nickname. It is also very durable and has sharp claws, capable of tearing through even the skin of a pseudogiant. It lets out a characteristic roar while jumping, frighteningly similar to a person’s. They’ve have mainly been encountered in the northern parts of the Zone, in open places near facilities or complexes. As told by local hunter Trapper, they have their own sphere of influence, where they rest and hunt during late at night. There is also a subspecies, namely the black chimera. It cannot be seen at all in the dark, which makes it much more dangerous than its relatives, as the usual ones have almost human skin colour. It is also said to be stronger and more enduring. Escaping from a chimera is practically impossible. It’s better to find a narrow room that will hamper its manoeuvrability, or try to jump aside while it leaps at you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_14">
		<text>Wild boars and flesh. The latter are an example of a terribly mutated pig, as proven by scientists. Those creatures are rather sluggish and weak, and only a complete muppet could get under its bladed paws, which will penetrate virtually any armour. As for boars, differ little from their relatives outside the Zone, apart from the fact that they are larger and more dangerous… Oh, and their hooves are much stronger, cutting through fabric and human flesh effortlessly. It’s enough just to jump aside and move somewhere in a couple of metres when these beasts rush at you, to avoid their fangs. Oftentimes, stalkers like to meat of wild boars and flesh alike, but not without treating it beforehand to avoid radiation poisoning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_monsters_trader_hangar_15">
		<text>Karliks… Thanks for helping me gather information about them. Here’s what I’ve jotted down: they mainly reside in underground complexes, most of which have previously been used for experiments on people. Apparently, karliks are the result of such experiments. They possess supernatural strength, good speed, and attack most often in groups. At the moment, only one subspecies has been discovered: smoked ones. They’re nasty buggers mutated by anomalies, and they emit dangerous radiation. Best not to go near them without a Wrenched or a Bubble in your pocket.</text>

	<string id="aslan_st_0">
		<text>What’s the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_1">
		<text>Well, the Syndicate only has one central base in the Zone, and it’s right here. The path to Yantar is cut off because of the psy-installation, and crowds of zombies sometimes come out of there, along with mutants. Our guys occupy Limansk to the north, but other than that, that place has gone to shit. It’s a maze full of Monolith. At the army warehouses in the east, it’s all Freedom territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
		<text>As for any dangers, you’ll see those for yourself. Keep in mind, though: when carrying out orders, you’ve got a job to do, and any emotions are just gonna distract you. Just put those aside. There’s no room for emotion, no room for morality, only intellect and calculation. And regarding other paths, the safest route is through Limansk. There’s plenty of closed space where you’ll be safe from sniper fire, and you can hide from firefights as well as anomalies in shelter located around the city. The area’s generally quite unpredictable, however. You can never know what exactly’s around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
		<text>You say that this base is central. Does that mean there are any other outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
		<text>There are three locations I know of that are under our control. The first one is in the southern part of Zaton, at the edge of the marshes. The second one is being held by a detachment of ours in the south-west part of the Pripyat outskirts, and the third squadron is stationed in the Red Forest, at the bridge to Limansk, where we’ve also got a supplier. Other than that, you can find our squads in various parts of the Zone when they’re carrying out contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
		<text>So anything north of Limansk is Monolith territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
		<text>Pretty much. There’s an old hospital not far from Limansk, and there’s absolutely no point in going there. The path to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the one leading to Yantar are both cut off by psy-emissions. After you reach Limansk, stay on the southern road and make sure you’ve got some supplies with you.</text>

Anyway, I stabbed him with a screwdriver. Good thing that he didn’t die right then and there. Spent a few years in maximum security while my bitch wife sold everything and ran off. When I got released, I spent all my money on drinks and ended up in the slums. Got here when the Zone came about. Here, everyone’s equal. We’re all outcasts. I met up with the blokes at the Garbage.

		<text>Work? I don’t think you can help me… Actually, wait. My comrades and I went to the truck cemetery for a recon assignment. You know the place? A boundless area with the empty shells of many Soviet vehicles. We were told there was a squad of Freedomers somewhere in the vicinity. Never managed to find those bastards… but we did find something else. Something frightening, that—that made my friends… fall to their knees and grab their heads. I have no idea why the same didn’t happen to me, or how I managed to run away. It’s a shame. Look, I certainly don’t believe that my guys are still alive, as they’ve been gone for a couple of days… but can you at least confirm their deaths? I’ll send you the coordinates via PDA; it’s near some kind of chemical anomaly. Can you help me, stalker?</text>

Apparently, that’s the place the Monolith carry out their orders and all important procedures regarding the territory of the Zone. So the stalker’s already gone there, and I think he’s serious. His intervention might have a major impact on the Zone. The leaders of a few factions have already expressed their discontent regarding this information.</text>

Now he’s just sitting there, absolutely devastated by what happened. It was his first artefact, and they call it a Pellicle. I would go look for it myself, but I can’t leave the rookies alone.

		<text>My shit got turned upside down, you know what I’m saying? I ended up in the Zone because I was a fuckup of a kid with a dangerous bloody taste for beer. My ‘friends’ asked me to be their lookout while they were cleaning out a store, stealing a couple of cigarette boxes and a crate of beer, when suddenly, the cops arrived. The guys got in a panic and started thinking of where to hide before giving up and running, throwing away everything they stole!… but I ran slower than everyone else, and long story short: I got caught. I didn’t rat those shitheads out, even though the only possible outcome was taking the blame for the whole lot, and God knows how I was going to get treated in prison after something like that. I got locked up for four years and left that place on parole a grown man. I thought to myself that I wouldn’t get involved in this kind of shit anymore; that I’d find a job and rent some place, get my life in order.</text>

			<text>Well, things haven’t moved forward. Got no job, no cash, and the guys I served time with pretended I never existed. The big wheel back in prison noticed me while we were working together in the workshop, and told me that my work was better than anyone he’d seen. He told me that I should run away to the Zone; that he knows some groups there, and that I could find some local work with his boys. I had no other choice. I would’ve joined the stalkers, but I didn’t know anyone else when I got here. I didn’t have enough money for even a hunting rifle, and if the cops caught me again, I’d have a fat chance of getting another shot at parole. You know, I don’t like all this ‘prison romanticism’, glorifying the crimes and injustices they’ve committed. These concepts of theirs are alien to me, and they’re just out of place here in the Zone. This isn’t the same world as back on the mainland… They could’ve had a new start. I dream of saving up some money and leaving this godforsaken shithole, leaving all of this in the past.</text>

		<text>Eh, not quite. We don’t collect artefacts, we don’t adhere to any common views on the Zone, and we certainly don’t try to unravel its secrets. Our job is to hunt mutants, and not because they represent a threat, as Duty seems to wholeheartedly believe, but because of the thrill of the hunt. Many of us were former hunters, both amateurs and professionals outside of the Zone. Many perished, as they weren’t prepared for the level of… unpredictability the Zone showed them. Oh, and the trenchcoat; you’ll come to understand that such outfits are quite ideal for hunting, as the mobility they offer is certainly useful. We also try to stay out of any armed conflicts between other groups of stalkers, and the coats help us stand out in that regard, acting as an unofficial uniform of sorts.</text>

Now, we have taken an interest in the anomalous grove in the Red Forest, which is located in the middle of a Symbiont anomalous zone. We will need samples of bark from from the most twisted and mutated trees that can be found there. Will you help us?</text>

		<text>Are you in charge here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_1">
		<text>That I am. Name’s Loki, right hand of Miklukha at this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_2">
		<text>An interesting name. It’s like the Scandinavian deity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_3">
		<text>That’s what it is. It’s what they called me in the early days, right around when the Brain Scorcher showed up. Those were crazy times.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_4">
		<text>Could you tell me more about the events after the Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
		<text>Sure. When the Scorcher was shut down, my squad launched a campaign towards the north. We went on for some time, going through different places… As the Chernobyl power plant loomed on the horizon, we decided to look for a place to set up camp and found this station while it was empty. The Zone turned to hell, and Duty appeared. The places were strange, there weren’t many people, and times were wild with emissions. After calling a truce, we agreed to keep all weapons holstered and knives sheathed in this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
		<text>And where is Duty now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
		<text>They’re not here. Anyone who we didn’t manage to shoot down ran off. Not long ago, a stalker by the name of Sasha appeared and helped us out considerably. The man did a lot of good things. The last piece of the puzzle he gave us was the PDA of the man who founded Duty, and according to it, he and his group were former military. Seems like he just cut off comms with the headquarters, which made local stalkers go nuts and left enemy forces confused. We kept a careful balance in this station. And thanks to the help of that stalker, we’ve been getting all kinds of support, from free stalkers, defectors, sympathisers, you name it. We’ve basically forced Duty out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_8">
		<text>And where did the stalker go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
		<text>I don’t know. Last I heard, he was heading towards Jupiter with some kind of fireteam. He was a good man, hopefully he’s alive and kicking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
		<text>What makes the local environment dangerous?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
		<text>It’s full of mutant. On top of that, you’ve got the Monolith, who have completely taken over the old depot. Other than that, some areas are crawling with zombies, such as the old village of Kopachy west of us, along with the ventilation complex and the Volkhov AA complex. Keep your eyes peeled, mate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_12">

		<text>My brother, why have you come here?</text>

		<text>To fulfill my innermost desire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="main_monolith_mlr_task_1_dlg_1_2">
		<text>That very desire is the lifeblood of the brotherhood. The Monolith has changed. Now, the brotherhood is supported only by a number of zealots. Many former fighters of ours deserted us after the shutdown of the Brain Scorcher. Some have remained simply because they would die outside the brotherhood, but this does not mean that they will not leave sooner or later. And some, like the two of us, have stayed here because we want to build our own personal paradise; with the technologies of the C-Consciousness, that is a concrete possibility.</text>

	<string id="main_monolith_mlr_task_1_dlg_1_3">
		<text>When will we be able to bring our dream to fruition?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="main_monolith_mlr_task_1_dlg_1_4">
		<text>All in due time, my brother. Remember that your old life is coming to an end. Over time, the brotherhood has decreased in numbers but increased in fervour. What you will be experiencing here will, to any objectively normal person, seem a true horror. To begin with, I want to observe your willpower. I want you to put an end to the pseudogiant roaming around in this city, without the use of your current equipment. However you manage to accomplish the objective—with your bare hands, with the help of your fellow brothers, or with the help of any weaponry you might find—is of no matter to me. You will reveal to yourself what you are capable of for the sake of achieving your goal and what means you will end up resorting to. Now, be on your way!</text>

		<text>The C-Consciousness is weak. Now, it is not enough to keep even a handful of people in check… At this time, mutants have no place amongst our forces. Nonetheless, admirable work. Your possessions are in the blue box in the other room. When you’re ready for the next challenge, return to me.</text>

So, listen up: at one time, there were a lot of men in our unit. Our might was something for all the heretics to fear… that was, until some stalker sabotaged the local ‘brainwashing facility’. The ensuing firefight had to be witnessed to be believed: Duty, Freedom, the loners, and the military, assaulting us all at once. Our unit was thrashed, and not even our best members survived the battle. But still: even now, nobody has managed to take control of this area. I don’t know what happened here, but the area’s completely infested by walking corpses and all kinds of nasty creatures.</text>

I don’t remember a lot about it, as I was on a mission with Preacher at the time… but I digress. Crystal held out until their last breath, but I think you understand their fate by now. You should rummage through the sarcophagus and see if you can get some more details of what went down from their PDAs… or even a weapon, since I’m sure they’re not using them anymore.

I’m not a real soldier, so they put me here in Yantar… Anyway, they call me Rookie; not far from the truth. Usually, I take to drinking because it’s so depressing around here. If that ain’t enough, this is the main base of the scientists, meaning my officers come here for inspections from time to time, and they don’t really fancy seeing alcohol… Last time they were here, they poured my vodka out right before my eyes.

I’ve also got a few outfits; everything I’ve managed to steal is mine. What do you say about trading with me for a few bottles of Cossacks? For five bottles, I can offer you six mags of 9x18, or three mags of 5.45. For ten bottles, I can share six mags of 5.45, two mags of 7.62, or five packs of 12x70 buckshot rounds. For fifteen bottles and seven thousand roubles, I can get you five box mags for the PKP, and for twenty bottles, I’ll fetch you an entire Berill suit from the bins… Don’t think I’m a scoundrel. It’s not that bad, and the lion’s share goes to the guys. They’ve left me their equipment in a stash. I’ll leave any goods between the hangars outside the bunker.</text>

	<string id="newbee_monolith_stalker_4_dlg_1">
		<text>You know, I used to be an experienced loner, and throughout travels, I had heard stories of the Monolith’s power, like a child’s tale. Ever since then, I’ve dreamed about joining them.

		<text>I desire nothing more than to give myself to the Monolith. There is nobody waiting for me on the mainland, and no life outside of the Zone interests me in any way. The power that we wield is the most important in the world. Now… I must meditate. We can speak another time.</text>

		<text>Impressive reasoning. Because this was a serious matter, I had an assistant shadow you during the interviews. Do not worry, the traitor has been dealt with.

You have earned it, and it will surely come in handy.</text>

There’s hope for beginners here; to get something valuable and dear without having to travel to the centre of the Zone. So they’ve pushed forward, and I’m one of them.

		<text>What can you tell me about Cold?</text>

		<text>What can I say? He’s earned quite a bit of respect as the current leader of our organisation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>How did he earn that respect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You see, there was some controversy regarding Lebedev, our former leader—who, by the way, I personally never met—and he didn’t seem to take the opinions of the faction members into account during their reckless crusade towards the CNPP. That mercenary certainly helped us out, but in the end, it just wasn’t worth it. Those who remained at the base were unable to fight back against a resurgence made by the renegades. The significance of our struggle in the swamps was reduced to zero… and the sacrifices here and on the way to the Chernobyl NPP turned out to be in vain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>It seems like the faction’s resentment towards their leader at that time was justified.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>There’s more to it. After our troops managed to return, we had to start a long conflict to take everything back. We wouldn’t be able to manage in day-to-day life without Cold. He rallied up a number of unaffiliated stalkers and got in touch with folks throughout the Garbage and the Cordon. Free stalkers helped us out, and having a charismatic leader certainly didn’t hurt. Moreover, he’s given an order to all fighters, without exceptions, not to leave this place. We’ll take any help, but we won’t continue risking the lives of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
		<text>Whoever Lebedev was and what he did, you don’t seem to be the same faction as you used to be.</text>

		<text>That’s your opinion; certainly has some value to it. Right now, we have no large-scale goals, nor any common ideology… Anyway, it’s probably time we cut the storytelling and start the trading.</text>

North of us is the truck cemetery, and our boys there control the old checkpoint and the entrance to the army warehouses. Try not to hang around the cemetery at night, and stay away from all the old vehicles. Radiation levels there are high enough to make your counter ring down to your goolies, and that’s not even mentioning the creatures and anomalies. There’s the Garbage to the west; total chaos over there, and there’s a checkpoint to the north controlled by Duty. South of us is a forest called the Darkscape. Really wild place. You’ve got soldiers patrolling there from time to time and loners pissing about. Pretty big maze. Also, there are a few stalkers at the farm on the way to the Darkscape, so don’t fuck around. There’s a huge advantage in that forest: the road leads to the Cordon. You’ll easily find our guys at the vehicle station there.</text>

There are mutants in the lower lands, and it’s better to find and stay on high ground, or stay by the warehouses… although, the mercs have those covered. That’s all about the Wild Territory. To the north lie the army warehouses, held by Duty’s ‘best friend’, Freedom. There’s nothing particularly interesting going on there, but it’s the last shelter around for sane people. To the east is the truck cemetery; stock up on anti-radiation supplies and ammo if you’re going there. There are a lot of mutants and sometimes the radiation is way past what even we consider to be normal. To the south is the Garbage… Complete anarchy going on over there.

All the ensuing chaos got interesting: soldiers scurrying about, loners around the area, Monolithians completely exhausted.

		<text>You really haven’t heard about them? Some might dismiss them as a myth, but I know for sure that they’re a group of expert scientists who somehow came into the noosphere. I managed to visit their laboratory in the north of the Zone, and let me tell you, they’ve got some fine technology: holograms, computers, other advanced equipment… It’s difficult to believe that it’s the result of combining modern Ukrainian inventions with old Soviet technology.
